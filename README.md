# python-api-challenge

I worked by myself on this challenge. The main piece of code I got from outside was for placing the equation in the linear regression plots. The code was from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7045729/automatically-position-text-box-in-matplotlib

and the location of the code is in line 28 of cell 13 (in my lin_reg function), where I use the annotate function.

I also used the starter code from bootcamp spot.
